# One-Pixel-Attack-for-fooling-depp-neural-network
The project is a research effort that explores the susceptibility of deep neural networks, particularly those used for image classification, to minimal input perturbations. It demonstrates the ability to manipulate a single pixel in an image, causing the neural network to misclassify the image.
